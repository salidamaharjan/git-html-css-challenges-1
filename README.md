## Updating the HTML and CSS according to the challenges requirements.

* I changed description on title tag that is clear and relevant.
* With this challenge I learned about the semantic HTML tags such as header, footer, section, article and aside, and made changes on my repo.
## Semantic HTML reference

* Removed the class of header and footer since the tag selectors are used to style.
* Added `alt=""` attribute to `<img>`tag which gives the decription to the user in case image not visible.
